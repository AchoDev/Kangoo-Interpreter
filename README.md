## Introduction

KANGOO is very bare bones programming language.
It's not really made to be practical and is actually just built on top of java.
Therefore it compiles to Java.

## Syntax

### Variables

To create a variable first you need the "var" keyword, then
the name and at last an equals sign with the value. If you put in
a String, it'll be a String, if you type in a whole number, it'll be an
Integer and so on.

``` swift
var name = "Ben"
var number = 15
```

But if you want to set a specific datatype, you can by using a colon, followed
by the type.

``` swift
var:String name = "Ben"
var:int number = 15
```

You can do simple maths with integers and add Strings together, which will
make put them behind each other.
